# UCSC RiddleRun - Treasure Hunt Backend

This repository contains the RiddleRun treasure-hunt backend used in uni events (UCSC IEEE Day 2022, 2023, IEEE Intro Day, etc). It is built using PHP and MySQL. 

DB Dump file is included in the repository.

The frontend can be found at: 
 - [github.com/IEEEUCSC/riddle-run-2023](https://github.com/IEEEUCSC/riddle-run-2023)
 - [github.com/IEEEUCSC/ieee-day-2022/tree/master/treasure-hunt](https://github.com/IEEEUCSC/ieee-day-2022/tree/master/treasure-hunt)
 
This was created back in 2022. Code quality may not be up to standards, but it works for its intended purpose. Please ignore any bad-practices, logical flaws, or security issues you may find. I was just lazy to correct them before public release :)
